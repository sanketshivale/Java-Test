## Problem Descriptions

### Q1: Merge two arrays by satisfying given constraints

Merge two arrays by satisfying given constraints
Given two sorted arrays X[] and Y[] of size m and n each where m >= n and X[] has exactly n vacant cells,
 merge elements of Y[] in their correct position in array X[], i.e., merge (X, Y) by keeping the sorted order.

For example,

Input: X[] = { 0, 2, 0, 3, 0, 5, 6, 0, 0 }
Y[] = { 1, 8, 9, 10, 15 } The vacant cells in X[] is represented by 0 
Output: X[] = { 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 15 }


#### Q1 Solution File Name (MergeArrays.java)

Output of the program
```
shiv@shiv-Inspiron-3501:~/Desktop/New Folder$ cd "/home/shiv/Desktop/New Folder/" && javac MergeArrays.java && java MergeArrays
Enter the size of array X:
9
Enter elements of array X:
0 2 0 3 0 5 6 0 0
Enter the size of array Y:
5
Enter elements of array Y:
1 8 9 10 15
Merged array: [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 15]
```

### Q2: Find maximum sum path involving elements of given arrays
Given two sorted arrays of integers, find a maximum sum path involving elements of both arrays whose sum is maximum. 
We can start from either array, but we can switch between arrays only through its common elements.

For example,

Input: X = { 3, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 15, 18, 100 }
Y = { 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 15, 16, 18, 25, 50 }  
The maximum sum path is: 1 —> 2 —> 3 —> 6 —> 7 —> 9 —> 10 —> 12 —> 15 —> 16 —> 18 —> 100 
The maximum sum is 199

#### Q2 Solution File Name (MaximumSumPath.java)

Output of the program
```
shiv@shiv-Inspiron-3501:~/Desktop/New Folder$ cd "/home/shiv/Desktop/New Folder/" && javac MaximumSumPath.java && java MaximumSumPath
Enter the size of array X:
9
Enter elements of array X:
3                                      
6
7
8
10
12
15
18
100
Enter the size of array Y:
13
Enter elements of array Y:
1
2
3
5
7
9
10
11
15
16
18
25
50
Maximum sum path: 199
```

### Q3: Merge two arrays by satisfying given constraints

Write a Java Program to count the number of words in a string using HashMap.


#### Q3 Solution File Name (WordCount.java)

Output of the program
```
shiv@shiv-Inspiron-3501:~/Desktop/New Folder$ cd "/home/shiv/Desktop/New Folder/" && javac WordCount.java && java WordCount
Enter a string:
The String to count word in the string so we can get word count
{The=1, the=1, can=1, string=1, in=1, get=1, count=2, String=1, to=1, so=1, word=2, we=1}
```

### Q4: Write a Java Program to find the duplicate characters in a string.


#### Q4 Solution File Name (DuplicateCharacters.java)

Output of the program
```
shiv@shiv-Inspiron-3501:~/Desktop/New Folder$ cd "/home/shiv/Desktop/New Folder/" && javac DuplicateCharacters.java && java DuplicateCharacters
Duplicate characters in the enter string are as follows: 
l
i
a
t
e
r
y
S
n
```
